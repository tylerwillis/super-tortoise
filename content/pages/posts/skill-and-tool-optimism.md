You can be both happy and driven.

Calling someone an optimist is often a back-handed compliment. Optimists are seen as being naive in a way that makes them cute, but also a little stupid or dangerous. If you're optimistic about something, people will tell you to "wake up" or "be pragmatic," which is an implicit command to consider what's possible and shrink your dreams to fit.

That's terrible advice. You should be an optimist. You should believe things can be better. You should work to make them better. You can be happy and effective while you do it. And you can help other people be happier too.

## Why should you be an optimist?

People are happy when they think their world is getting better and all improvements require someone to come up with a new idea and work to achieve it.

Being optimistic gives you ideas about how to make things better, which is the first step in things getting better. If you want people to be happy, you need some optimists that are ambitious and working to make the world better. The more optimists you have, the more of them will be ambitious, and the better off the world will be.

When framed that way, I don't know many people that don't want ambitious optimists to exist, but I know many people who think they shouldn't be one. There's a lot going on in that belief, but there's one very rational reason why: the people chasing the biggest dreams are often extremely frustrated and unhappy in the present moment.

People that believe they can change things often start out dissatisfied by something (which is what motivates them to change it) and while they are trying to change it, they hit problems that cause them to worry that their vision for the future is wrong (imposter syndrome) or they become deeply frustrated by the many challenges and failures. They may push through that and accomplish their goal, but you wouldn't consider them happy while they are doing so.

I know how true that can be because I am one of those unhappy doers. Over the past 5-6 years, I've found some tools that help me be satisfied without losing my ambition to improve things, but I was a pretty helpless case for a long time. I even avoided going to therapy for several years because I was afraid that being happy would make me less ambitious, which felt like a very core part of my identity. When successful people gave advice about being less frustrated at work, adopting a more balanced working style, "trusting it would all work out," or anything similar, I dismissed it with a deep suspicion that their ambition may have made them unhappy at the moment, but it also made them successful. Advising that other people gamble on losing their drive seemed convenient and ill-advised.

If all of that was true — if you have to be unhappy to make things better — then I respect that many people would rationally choose not to do it. That would be the healthy choice.

But, I don't believe that anymore. I hope you don't hear this with the same suspicion I had, this is not generic advice to "relax" or "trust the process," these are things you can do to be happier and more ambitious at the same time.

If you take nothing else from this essay, here’s what I hope you’ll hear:

1.  **You can learn to be happy doing great things, even if you’re struggling with being happy or doing great things today.**

2.  **You should try to do great things: desire is good, and it doesn't need to be a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.**

3.  **You can be happy in the belief that improvement is possible, well before you make any actual improvement.**

## What is skill-and-tool optimism?

Skill-and-tool optimism is the belief that people can acquire skills, build tools, and use those to make the world a better place. If you have a strong belief in that, then you can go after ambitious goals that are outside of your current ability, and use that as motivation to develop the skills and tools that bring it within your ability. Failure at any step becomes more like a QA test, failure is information you can use to build better skills or tools. Once you build them, you can try to pass the test again.

The power of this is in two things: First, it assumes failure is part of doing the work. Failure becomes a reflection of your current ability, not a reflection of you as a person. Second, it keeps everything within your locus of control. If you fail, you just have to figure out what skills and tools you need to build next.

That combination is powerful. It gives you strong intrinsic motivation because everything is within your control (the only thing out of your control is the time it will take you, which will be different for all people), and it allows you to be happy with your current state, even if you haven't accomplished your goal yet — after all, building skills and tools was part of the plan all along.

Take this as an example: imagine you needed to chop down a tree alone in the middle of the desert without any tools. You know that it's possible, but it's highly unlikely that you could figure it out in a couple of hours. Even if you tried all sorts of bad ideas prior to deciding to build an axe, wouldn't you still feel pretty resourceful and smart when you figured out you needed to build an axe? Even if it took you a week to figure out how to make an axe from stones and branches around you, wouldn't you still feel pretty accomplished when you figured out how to seat the blade? You'd be reinventing some core parts of human knowledge from scratch — you'd expect some setbacks and take pride in having the gumption to stick with it. When something failed, you'd think about what skill or tool you were missing and how to build it.

#### Do you need to chase a big idea?

In their book Zero-to-One, Peter Thiel and Blake Masters [argue](https://blakemasters.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-13-notes) that the world needs "Definite Optimism," where people set ambitious specific goals for how to improve the world (and then work to make them true), as opposed to "Indefinite Optimism," where people iterate in interesting spaces to discover improvements.

Their argument resonates with me. While you can do great things without a vision of what you want to accomplish, it's much harder to know whether you're making progress. When you have a clear vision you're working towards, encountering failure along the way is important information that you may be missing a skill or tool required to achieve your goal. Without a clear goal, it's easier to interpret failure as a dead end and move on to the next area. You may not improve the skills or tools you can use, you just move on to another part of the idea space and mine there.

Skill-and-tool optimism can work whether you have a clear vision or not, but I would strongly bias you towards having one. If you have a big goal, believe that self-improvement is required to accomplish that, and (critically) focus mostly on the process of self-improvement that is required to achieve the outcome, then you don't have to worry that your vision may be slightly wrong (you can update it with new information) or that you haven't achieved your goal yet (you can figure out what skills and tools would let you keep working towards it). You can be content in the present moment while working for something you care about in the future.

### How S\&T Optimism works

Skill-and-tool optimism is a fantastic personal philosophy. You intentionally build beliefs that inspire both the actions and emotional state that you want. Then, the way those beliefs interact is self re-enforcing: when you believe that worthwhile change is both hard and possible, you are motivated to develop new skills and tools to try to accomplish it. When you see small breakthroughs because of your hard work, it gives you more faith that change is possible. That loop

Developing a belief in skill-and-tool optimism is a simple practice. If you're reading this, you can do it. Here's what you have to do: find ways to develop and re-enforce the following beliefs:

1.  **Optimism:** a belief that huge positive changes are just hard, not impossible.

2.  **Self-improvement:** a belief that you can intentionally get better by developing skills and using tools, and that you can do so continuously.

3.  **Internal focus:** a belief that failure is just feedback that helps with self-improvement, not something that invalidates you or your efforts.

4.  **Pro-social:** a belief that people's success is proof of their effort and should re-enforce your optimism (and that yours is the same and will similarly inspire others).

5.  **Desire:** a belief that accomplishing something, even if it's hard, is satisfying and worthwhile.

Some of us are lucky enough to have experiences that lead us to develop those beliefs; most of us do not. But, if the experiences we have day-to-day are how we develop these beliefs, then we can engineer experiences that start teaching us these. This is hard and can take some time, but it's not impossible. (There's optimism showing through). If you hold these beliefs strongly, it makes you happier, more ambitious, more excited, and leads to you having better relationships with the world and people around you.

You may have some of these already. You may struggle with some more acutely. You may struggle with all of them. Everyone has a different starting point. As far as I can tell: even small improvements lead to small improvements in your life pretty immediately, these beliefs are reinforcing enough that you get more improvement for the same effort the longer you work at it, and there's no ceiling on how much better you can make your experience. Whether you're 8 or 80, why wouldn't you start now and get however far you can?

## How to build the beliefs

You can build this muscle from almost any starting point, it just requires breaking a big goal into small-enough goals that your feedback loop is quick and positive enough to continue motivating you. This is a little bit like level-design in a video game: where you try to match the level's difficulty to the skill that the player has at that exact time: making it hard enough to be challenging, but not so hard that it's demotivating. Finding the ideal balance on that is hard. Great teachers or coaches can help by using their experience to help us set achievable goals and connect them to a bigger outcome, but great teachers and coaches are rare. When I first started working on my interior life, my primary goal was to find ways to be happier and avoid depression/burnout. I've gotten lots of help from people on that journey, especially therapists, but I wasn't lucky enough to find a good teacher or coach that could break this down for me. Sometimes I progressed slowly, sometimes I bit off more than I could chew, but I've had to be my own guide. (In retrospect, I see that this has been a very skill-and-tool optimistic way to come up with the idea of skill-and-tool optimism).

I was "lucky" in another area: I was born with a very obsessive personality. While my obsessive nature probably caused a lot of the challenges that led me here, when I become obsessed with my interior life I got motivation and re-enforcement from learning about myself instead of achieving something that would be visible to others. That helped me do a lot of work without the fear of looking stupid (while I felt like a failure often in the early days, there was no external pass or fail on how I reflected on my thoughts).

Even with that advantage, it took me about 20 years from the first time I experienced deep unhappiness to when I really started trying to solve this problem. In the 5 or 6 years since then, I've become more skilled, but I'm nowhere near done with the work. I doubt I'll ever feel done - I haven't hit diminishing returns on doing this work yet and I suspect there's relatively infinite compounding available in the lessons I can learn on this in the decades to come.

#### Where to start

First things first, I want to review those 5 beliefs that I think make up the core of S\&T Optimism. Read these and honestly react to each one. Which of these feel natural? Which of these are you skeptical of? Which do you believe but struggle with? Which do you strongly disagree with?

1.  **Optimism:** a belief that huge positive changes are just hard, not impossible.

2.  **Self-improvement:** a belief that you can intentionally get better by developing skills and using tools, and that you can do so continuously.

3.  **Internal focus:** a belief that failure is just feedback that helps with self-improvement, not something that invalidates you or your efforts.

4.  **Pro-social:** a belief that people's success is proof of their effort and should re-enforce your optimism (and that yours is the same and will similarly inspire others).

5.  **Desire:** a belief that accomplishing something, even if it's hard, is satisfying and worthwhile.

Grab a journal and write out your thoughts. What emotional reaction do you have to each? In what situations recently have you acted like you believed that or not acted like you believed that. How did your parents encourage or discourage these beliefs when you were young? (Yes, I know this seems like a therapy trope, but there's a reason therapists ask about this. Our beliefs are guided by our experiences, and we react to experiences in ways that are comfortable to us — experiences and beliefs reinforce each other and if a pattern gets set early, it creates a 'groove' that's easy for our thoughts to slip into and make into a strong habitual pattern over time).

Preferably, take a break at this point. Just reflect on those thoughts for a little while.

When you come back to this, try to put aside those reactions and think about a future you that believes these things. How do you think you'd be different? Would being that person be better? Does this elicit any fear? Would you risk losing any part of yourself that you really love?

I'm a little worried at this point that this sounds like cult re-programming. Before I go any further, let me note that you don't become a new person by  encouraging these beliefs

I hope that by writing this I can help you achieve some of the same understanding more quickly.

This is like meditation for anxious people.

"Comparison is the thief of joy" - every person you admire failed thousands of times.  Being focused on your own work & the knowledge that failure is part of self-improvement and doesn't invalidate you.

Get more or desire less.

Optimism and naivety do not need to go hand-in-hand. If you believe that society can intentionally get better, you naturally should believe that you and other people can get better too. You can focus on an immediate practice: improve your skills and tools, use those to improve the world around you, and give those skills and tools freely to others.

Without any magical thinking, you can immediately create a positive feedback where you inspire others through positive change and get inspired in return to keep going. As a personal philosophy, skill-and-tool optimism is a practical way to be happier, more effective, and more pro-social.

Just having a vision for how the world can be better isn't enough, you need to also have the belief that you can get better too. You might be lucky enough to have that belief innately, but most people have to develop it intentionally.

(and many who would prefer that people they know well not step into the role either)
