excerpt: >-
  Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to
  as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest,
  undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation
  aside.

## You can be both happy and driven.

Calling someone an optimist is often a back-handed compliment. Optimists are seen as being naive in a way that makes them cute, but also a little stupid or dangerous. If you're optimistic about something, people will tell you to "wake up" or "be pragmatic," which is an implicit command to consider what's possible and shrink your dreams to fit.

That's terrible advice. You should be an optimist. You should believe things can be better. You should dream big dreams. You should work to make them happen. You can be happy and effective while you do it. And you can help other people be happier too.

## Why should you be an optimist?

People are happy when they think their world is getting better and all improvements require someone to come up with a new idea and work to achieve it.

Being optimistic gives you ideas about how to make things better, which is the first step in things getting better. If you want people to be happy, you need some optimists that are ambitious and working to make the world better. The more optimists you have, the more of them will be ambitious, and the better off the world will be.

When framed that way, I don't know many people that don't want ambitious optimists to exist, but I know many people who think they shouldn't be one. There's a lot going on in that belief, but there's one very rational reason why: the people chasing the biggest dreams are often extremely frustrated and unhappy in the present moment.

People that believe they can change things often start out dissatisfied by something (which is what motivates them to change it) and while they are trying to change it, they hit problems that cause them to worry that their vision for the future is wrong (imposter syndrome) or they become deeply frustrated by the many challenges and failures. They may push through that and accomplish their goal, but you wouldn't consider them happy while they are doing so.

I know how true that can be because I am one of those unhappy doers. Over the past 5-6 years, I've found some tools that help me be satisfied without losing my ambition to improve things, but I was a pretty helpless case for a long time. I even avoided going to therapy for several years because I was afraid that being happy would make me less ambitious, which felt like a very core part of my identity. When successful people gave advice about being less frustrated at work, adopting a more balanced working style, "trusting it would all work out," or anything similar, I dismissed it with a deep suspicion that their ambition may have made them unhappy at the moment, but it also made them successful. Advising that other people gamble on losing their drive seemed convenient and ill-advised.

If all of that was true — if you have to be unhappy to make things better — then I respect that many people would rationally choose not to do it. That would be the healthy choice. But, I don't believe that anymore. I hope you don't hear this with the same suspicion I had, this is not generic advice to "relax" or "trust the process," these are things you can do to be happier and more ambitious at the same time.

If you take nothing else from this essay, here’s what I hope you’ll hear:

1.  **You can be happy doing great things, even if you’re struggling with being happy or doing great things today.**

2.  **You should try to do great things: desire is good, and it doesn't need to be a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.**

3.  **You can be happy in the belief that improvement is possible, well before you make any actual improvement.**

## What is skilled optimism?

Skilled optimism is the belief that people can acquire and use skills to make the world a better place.

This works because it's self re-enforcing: when you believe that worthwhile change is both hard and possible, you are motivated to develop new skills and tools to try to accomplish it. When you see small breakthroughs because of your hard work, it gives you more faith that change is possible.

Developing a belief in skilled optimism is a simple practice. If you're reading this, you can do it. You have to find ways to develop and re-enforce the following beliefs:

1.  **Optimism:** a belief that huge positive changes are just hard, not impossible.

2.  **Self-improvement:** a belief that you can intentionally get better by developing skills and using tools, and that you can do so continuously.

3.  **Internal focus:** a belief that failure is just feedback that helps with self-improvement, not something that invalidates you or your efforts.

4.  **Pro-social:** a belief that people's success is proof of their effort and should re-enforce your optimism (and that yours is the same and will similarly inspire others).

5.  **Desire:** a belief that accomplishing something, even if it's hard, is satisfying and worthwhile.

None of us are born believing all of those things. Some of us develop those beliefs through our life experiences; most of us do not. By trying to change our experience, we can develop those beliefs. Once we develop them, they are

If you look at that list and thi

The world can get better if you get better, you can get better, and there's no requirement to "win" the race

## How to build the mindset if you don't have it

You can build this muscle from almost any starting point, it just requires breaking a big goal into small-enough goals that your feedback loop is quick and positive enough to continue motivating you. This is hard. Great teachers or coaches can help by using their experience to help us set achievable goals and connect them to a bigger outcome, but great teachers and coaches are rare. I wasn't lucky enough to have this experience.

Curiousity and obsession are great hacks. They reframe the goal from accomplishment to learning, which allows for a much faster and more positive loop.

## ---

You have to have a vision for what change you'd like to make. But, if you believe that self-improvement is required to accomplish that vision, and focus on the process of self-improvement instead of the outcome, then you don't have to worry that your vision may be wrong (you can update it) or that you haven't achieved your goal yet (you can keep working on it). You can be content in the present moment while working for something you care about in the future.

Even with that advantage, it took me 15-30 years to develop . i hope this is a short circuit for others.

"Comparison is the thief of joy" - every person you admire failed thousands of times.  Being focused on your own work & the knowledge that failure is part of self-improvement and doesn't invalidate you.

Get more or desire less.

Optimism and naivety do not need to go hand-in-hand. If you believe that society can intentionally get better, you naturally should believe that you and other people can get better too. You can focus on an immediate practice: improve your skills and tools, use those to improve the world around you, and give those skills and tools freely to others.

Without any magical thinking, you can immediately create a positive feedback where you inspire others through positive change and get inspired in return to keep going. As a personal philosophy, Skilled Optimism is a practical way to be happier, more effective, and more pro-social.

Just having a vision for how the world can be better isn't enough, you need to also have the belief that you can get better too. You might be lucky enough to have that belief innately, but most people have to develop it intentionally.

(and many who would prefer that people they know well not step into the role either)
