excerpt: >-
  Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to
  as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest,
  undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation
  aside.

## You can be both happy and driven.

Calling someone an optimist is often a back-handed compliment. Optimists are seen as having a naive nature that makes them cute, but also a little stupid or dangerous. People will tell you to "wake up" or "be pragmatic," which is an implicit command to consider what's possible and shrink your dreams to fit. That's terrible advice.

Resigning ourselves to cynicism is choosing to lead poorer lives. Big dreams help us thrive because people are happy when they think their world is getting better. All improvements require someone to come up with a new idea and work intentionally to achieve it. Thank god some do.

Sadly, the people chasing the biggest dreams often find themselves frustrated and unhappy. They often start out dissatisfied (their motivation for change) and then encounter roadblocks that cause them to worry that their vision for the future is wrong or become deeply frustrated by the many challenges and failures. They may be driven enough to push through that and accomplish their goal, but you wouldn't consider them happy. 

That isn't the only way to do great things. Desire doesn't need to be a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want, you can be happy in the belief that improvement is possible, well before you make any actual improvement.

This essay encapsulates what I think is the best way to do this: adopting a practical philosophy that allows you to acknowledge those frustrations and move past them. This is the best way I've found to be personally happy while caring about accomplishing something hard. I hope it serves some of you as well as it has served me.

## Skilled optimism

Skilled optimism is the belief that people can acquire and use skills to make the world a better place.

This works because it's self re-enforcing: when you believe that worthwhile change is both hard and possible, you are motivated to develop new skills and tools to try to accomplish it. When you see small breakthroughs because of your hard work, it gives you more faith that change is possible.

Developing a belief in skilled optimism is a simple practice. If you're reading this, you can do it. You have to find ways to develop and re-enforce the following beliefs:

1.  \*\*Optimism: \*\*a belief that huge positive changes are just hard, not impossible.

2.  \*\*Self-improvement: \*\*a belief that you can intentionally get better by developing skills and using tools, and that you can do so continuously.

3.  \*\*Internal focus: \*\*a belief that failure is just feedback that helps with self-improvement, not something that invalidates you or your efforts.

4.  \*\*Pro-social: \*\*a belief that people's success is proof of their effort and should re-enforce your optimism (and that yours is the same and will similarly inspire others).

5.  \*\*Desire: \*\*a belief that accomplishing something, even if it's hard, is satisfying and worthwhile.

None of us are born believing all of those things. Some of us develop those beliefs through our life experiences; most of us do not. By trying to change our experience, we can develop those beliefs. Once we develop them, they are

If you look at that list and thi

The world can get better if you get better, you can get better, and there's no requirement to "win" the race

## How to build the mindset if you don't have it

You can build this muscle from almost any starting point, it just requires breaking a big goal into small-enough goals that your feedback loop is quick and positive enough to continue motivating you. This is hard. Great teachers or coaches can help by using their experience to help us set achievable goals and connect them to a bigger outcome, but great teachers and coaches are rare. I wasn't lucky enough to have this experience.

Curiousity and obsession are great hacks. They reframe the goal from accomplishment to learning, which allows for a much faster and more positive loop.

You have to have a vision for what change you'd like to make. But, if you believe that self-improvement is required to accomplish that vision, and focus on the process of self-improvement instead of the outcome, then you don't have to worry that your vision may be wrong (you can update it) or that you haven't achieved your goal yet (you can keep working on it). You can be content in the present moment while working for something you care about in the future.

Even with that advantage, it took me 15-30 years to develop . i hope this is a short circuit for others.

"Comparison is the thief of joy" - every person you admire failed thousands of times.  Being focused on your own work & the knowledge that failure is part of self-improvement and doesn't invalidate you.

Get more or desire less.

Optimism and naivety do not need to go hand-in-hand. If you believe that society can intentionally get better, you naturally should believe that you and other people can get better too. You can focus on an immediate practice: improve your skills and tools, use those to improve the world around you, and give those skills and tools freely to others.

Without any magical thinking, you can immediately create a positive feedback where you inspire others through positive change and get inspired in return to keep going. As a personal philosophy, Skilled Optimism is a practical way to be happier, more effective, and more pro-social.

Just having a vision for how the world can be better isn't enough, you need to also have the belief that you can get better too. You might be lucky enough to have that belief innately, but most people have to develop it intentionally.

Frequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the National Trail System in the USA and The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours are often made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of mountain huts.

In the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), trail (USA), The Grande Randonnée (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the Appalachian Trail in the USA and the Pennine Way in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury. Hiking times can be estimated by Naismith's rule or Tobler's hiking function.

## Equipment

The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of "Ten Essentials" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.

> Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. ― Cindy Ross

Proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.

## Environmental Impact

Natural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.

Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.
