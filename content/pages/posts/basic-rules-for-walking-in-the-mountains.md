  Hiking can sometimes involves bushwhacking and hiking is sometimes referred to
  as such. This specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest,
  undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation
  aside.

Calling someone an optimist is often a back-handed compliment. In uncertain times (all times are uncertain), optimists are seen as having a certain naive nature that makes them cute, but also a little dangerous. People worry that an optimist is ignoring warnings on the way to catastrophic failure. People will tell you to "wake up" or "be pragmatic," which is an implicit command to consider what's possible and shrink your dreams to fit it.

That is terrible advice. To thrive, both individually and as a society, big dreams are important. People are happy when they think their world is getting better, and the world doesn't get meaningfully better unless some people dream impossible dreams and then work intentionally to achieve them. We should all dream big dreams and work on achieving them; doing so will improve the world around us, for ourselves and for others.

Unfortunately, people that do this often find themselves frustrated and unhappy. They worry that their vision for the future is wrong or they become deeply frustrated by the many blockers in their way. That frustrated state is easy to fall into and can last for a lifetime, but it's completely unnecessary. If you develop the right attitude and work ethic, you don't have to worry that your vision may be wrong (you can update it) or that you haven't achieved your goal yet (you can keep working on it).

This essay encapsulates what I think is the best way to do this: adopting a practical philosophy that allows you to acknowledge those frustrations and move past them. This is the best way I've found to be personally happy while caring about accomplishing something hard.

## Skilled Optimism

Skilled optimism is the belief that people can acquire and use skills to make the world a better place.

Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want

Optimism and naivety do not need to go hand-in-hand. If you believe that society can intentionally get better, you naturally should believe that you and other people can get better too. You can focus on an immediate practice: improve your skills and tools, use those to improve the world around you, and give those skills and tools freely to others.

Without any magical thinking, you can immediately create a positive feedback where you inspire others through positive change and get inspired in return to keep going. As a personal philosophy, Skilled Optimism is a practical way to be happier, more effective, and more pro-social.

## Skilled Optimism

Frequently nowadays long distance hikes (walking tours) are undertaken along long distance paths, including the National Trails in England and Wales, the National Trail System in the USA and The Grande Randonnée (France), Grote Routepaden, or Lange-afstand-wandelpaden (Holland), Grande Rota (Portugal), Gran Recorrido (Spain) is a network of long-distance footpaths in Europe, mostly in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. There are extensive networks in other European countries of long distance trails, as well as in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nepal, and to a lesser extent other Asiatic countries, like Turkey, Israel, and Jordan. In the Alps of Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy walking tours are often made from 'hut-to-hut', using an extensive system of mountain huts.

In the late 20th-century there has been a proliferation of official and unofficial long distance routes, which mean that hikers now are more likely to refer to using a long distance way (Britain), trail (USA), The Grande Randonnée (France), etc., than setting out on a walking tour. Early examples of long distance paths, include the Appalachian Trail in the USA and the Pennine Way in Britain. Pilgrimage routes are now treated, by some walkers, as long distance routes, and the route taken by the British National Trail the North Downs Way closely follows that of the Pilgrims' Way to Canterbury. Hiking times can be estimated by Naismith's rule or Tobler's hiking function.

## Equipment

The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of "Ten Essentials" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.

> Returning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits. ― Cindy Ross

Proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.

## Environmental Impact

Natural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.

Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.
