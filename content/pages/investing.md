      ## Kepler Operator's Fund invests $2-4M/yr in startups and is open to
      accredited investors.


      When I started investing, I was one of the first people to raise a small
      VC fund without going full-time. I believed I could do both things well at
      the same time and that being an active operator gave me more ability to
      find interesting companies and provide relevant help to them.


      Since then, I've been one of the earliest investors in companies that are
      now incredibly successful, including Patreon (now worth $4B), Clubhouse
      ($4B), Lattice ($1B), MainStreet, On Deck, and several others.


      [Accredited investors can back the early-stage fund
      here](angel.co/v/l/STiEs). We also lead occasional growth-stage deals via
      a syndicate.
