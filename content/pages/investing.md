      ## Kepler Operator's Fund invests $2-4M/yr in startups and is open to
      accredited investors.


      When I started investing, I was one of the few people that raised a small
      VC fund while continuing to operate. I believed I could do both things
      well at the same time, and that being an active operator gave me more
      ability to find interesting companies and provide relevant help to them.


      Since then, I've been one of the earliest investors in companies that are
      now incredibly successful, including Patreon (now worth $4B), Clubhouse
      ($4B), Lattice ($1B), MainStreet, On Deck, and several others.
