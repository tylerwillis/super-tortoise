    title: 'About Me:'
    content: >
      I'm most well-known as a founder of Unsupervised, which helps companies
      discover opportunities in their data (over $50M worth in 2021) and has
      raised over $50M for some marquee venture investors. I prefer to think of
      myself more broadly as someone who believes very strongly in the ability
      to intentionally develop the skills and tools that make us happier and
      help us improve the world.


      I call this practice **Skilled Optimism** and I do a lot of things that
      help me practice and evangelize that concept. Currently, I'm building a
      company, I invest $2-4m/yr in promising startups, and I try to encourage
      other people to become more optimistic.
