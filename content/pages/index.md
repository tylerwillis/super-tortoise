    title: About
    content: >
      Most commonly, I'm introduced as the founder of a successful tech company,
      but I think of myself more as a polymath that believes very strongly in
      the ability to develop skills and tools that make us happier and help us
      improve the world. I believe in Skilled Optimism, and I do a lot of things
      that help me practice and evangelize that concept: I build better tools
      for the world, I invest in promising startups, and I evangelize increased
      optimism to whoever will listen.
