    title: 'About Me:'
    content: >
      I'm most well-known as the co-founder of Unsupervised, which helps
      companies discover opportunities in their data (over $55M worth in 2021)
      and has raised over $50M from top investors.


      I think of myself as someone who believes very strongly in the ability to
      intentionally develop skills and tools that make us happier and help
      improve the world. I call this **Skill-and-Tool Optimism** and I do a lot
      of things that help me practice and evangelize it.


      Currently, that includes building Unsupervised, investing $2-4m/yr in
      promising startups, and talking about skill and tool optimism via this
      blog and my podcast.

      This podcast gets pretty wonky about skills and tools, I try to show how
      people can get better and accomplish impressive things despite being in
      over their heads at the start.  


      Here are the public episodes. Every recording is shared first with a small
      audience that share common values. Because we vet our audience and build
      trust, guests are able to be vulnerable knowing our audience will be fair
      to them and their ideas. In a process that loosely resembles peer review,
      community members react to episodes and when both they and the guest agree
      the podcast is worthy, we publish the episode publicly.
