    title: 'About Me:'
    content: >
      I'm most well-known as the co-founder and COO of
      [Unsupervised](www.unsupervised.com), which helps companies discover
      opportunities in their data (over $60M found so far in 2021). We have
      raised over $50M from top VCs and have worked with 30% of Fortune 10
      companies.


      I think of myself as someone who believes very strongly in the ability to
      intentionally develop skills and tools that make us happier and help
      improve the world. I call this **Skill-and-Tool Optimism** and I do a lot
      of things that help me practice and evangelize it.


      Currently, that includes building Unsupervised, investing $2-4M/yr in
      promising startups, and talking about skill and tool optimism via this
      blog and my podcast.

      This podcast covers whatever I find interesting, and often gets wonky
      about skills and tools. I try to show how people accomplish impressive
      things by intentionally learning new things.
