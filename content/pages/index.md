    title: 'About Me:'
    content: >
      I'm most well-known for co-founding [Unsupervised](www.unsupervised.com),
      which helps companies discover opportunities in their data (over $60M has
      been found using Unsupervised so far). We have raised over $50M from top
      investors and have worked with 30% of Fortune 10 companies.


      I think of myself as someone who believes very strongly in the ability to
      intentionally develop skills and tools that make us happier and help
      improve the world. I call this **Skill-and-Tool Optimism** and I do a lot
      of things that help me practice and evangelize it.


      Currently, that includes building Unsupervised, investing $2-4M/yr in
      promising startups, and talking about skill and tool optimism via this
      blog and my podcast.

      This podcast covers whatever I find interesting, and often gets wonky
      about skills and tools. I try to show how people accomplish impressive
      things by intentionally learning new things.
