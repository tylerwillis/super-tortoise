    title: 'About Me:'
    content: >
      Most commonly, I'm introduced as the founder of a successful tech company.
      I prefer to think of myself as someone who believes very strongly in the
      ability to develop skills and tools that make us happier and help us
      improve the world.


      I call this practice **Skilled Optimism** and I do a lot of things that
      help me practice and evangelize that concept. Currently, I'm building a
      company, I invest in promising startups, and I try to encourage other
      people to become more optimistic.
