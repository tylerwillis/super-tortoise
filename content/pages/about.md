**Tyler Willis** is the co-founder of Unsupervised, which helps companies discover opportunities in their data (over $55M so far) and has raised over $50M from top investors including Cathay Innovation, SignalFire, Coatue, Eniac Ventures, and Elad Gil.

In addition to his work at Unsupervised, Tyler is an active angel investor — managing a $2-4M/yr fund that invests in early-stage technology companies. He's been an early-stage investor in companies like Patreon (now worth $4B), Clubhouse ($4B), Lattice ($1B), Lambda School, MainStreet, and On Deck.

Prior to founding Unsupervised, Tyler served as the CMO of Hired.com, a career marketplace that has raised over $100 Million to help talented people find jobs they love, and previously ran sales, growth marketing, partnerships, and M\&A across several top-performing startups. Insatiably curious, he's always looking for the next thing to learn.

The New Yorker described me like this: "People like Willis, young and urban and professionally diffuse, tend to regard success in terms of autonomy—designing your life as you want—rather than Napoleonic domination."

They weren't wrong, I do enjoy autonomy.
